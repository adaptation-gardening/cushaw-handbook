In general, cushaws will thrive under similar conditions to other squash. In Mexico near the likely origin of Curcubita argyrosperma, various strains of cushaws can be found growing in conditions that vary from intercropping with corn within intensive agricultural systems to feral and wild forms that self-seed.

In cool northern hemisphere climates, an area facing south is often best.

## Possibility of crossing

C. argyrosperma cushaws have been noted in English scientific literature to form interspecific hybrids with other Cucurbita squash. However, these hybrids should be considered unlikely to occur via natural pollination. Among the other squash species which are widely cultivated, Cucurbita moschata is often considered the most likely to hybridize with Cucurbita argyrosperma.

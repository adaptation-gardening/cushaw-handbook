Cushaws have been noted in English scientific literature to form interspecific hybrids with other. However, these hybrids should be considered unlikely to occur via natural pollination.

In general, cushaws will thrive under similar conditions to other squash. 

In Mexico, various strains of cushaws can be found growing in conditions that vary from intercropping with corn within intensive agricultural systems to feral and wild forms that self-seed.

In cool northern hemisphere climates, an area facing south is often best.

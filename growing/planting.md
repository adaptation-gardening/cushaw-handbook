# Planting

## Direct sowing

Squash seeds are easy to direct sow, and this is often the most effective choice assuming either an ample starting supply of seeds or an environment with low pest pressure.

To direct sow, drop individual seeds into a hole or furrow about ½” - 1” deep, cover with soil and press to make good contact. Seeds should be about 6” apart, a distance based on either nature or the gardener removing some plants as they grow to increase the amount of space per individual chilacayote plant.

Once the seeds have been planted, ensure that they are watered, whether by natural sources or by irrigation. With warmth and moisture, the seeds will germinate in a few days. By direct sowing, the tap root of the seedling can establish itself deeply in the soil, and avoid the risk of damage and shock that comes with transplantation.

## Starting cushaws indoors

Some situations call for starting indoors. For example, in short season climates, start seeds indoors 3-4 weeks before the last frost, at least during the first year or two to harvest squash as close to maturity as possible.

When starting the seeds indoors, it can be useful to add some of your native soil to the potting mix so the seeds develop relationships with soil microbes right from the start.

## When to plant outside

Squash plants are not frost-tolerant, and prefer soil temperatures above 50 F. Note that plants started indoors may need to acclimate to the outdoors before planting in the ground.

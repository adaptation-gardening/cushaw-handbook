# Roasted Cushaw Puree

Cushaw puree can be prepared using several methods. Oven-roasting the squash may be the simplest.

For a large winter squash fruit, a cook might store the fruit for a few months whole at room temperature. Then when the squash is first needed, the cook might prepare half of it, and freeze the other half either raw or as puree.

{: .note }
Squash freezes well both as cleaned and processed raw flesh and as cooked puree.

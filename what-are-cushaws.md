# What are cushaws?

This guide will focus on cultivating and using cushaw squash of the species Cucurbita argyrosperma, although there are also squash varieties traditionally known as cushaws which are classified as species Cucurbita moschata, and those which are interspecific hybrids between C. argyrosperma and C. moschata. Those two species are close relatives, and can be grown in the same way.
